## Summary  
This thesis discusses the possibility of using distributed blockchain database to build the inventory system. The main idea of using this type of technology was to increase the safety of users and the data collected in database. The goal of this thesis is to create StockTaker application operating in a distributed network. When the application is used, every information about the transaction by the user is published on the network and distributed to all active participants in order to verify the transactionâ€™s author and its content.
